## Insights
It took 7 days to get our first 5 users from getting our first user

There are around 26 % user (including fake accounts) are not posted any single content yet

There is no direct relation between posting content and getting likes (as there are some users have posted around 12 images but they not getting winning likes) “ users like Quality over Quantity ”

Most commonly used hashtags are indicating free fun enjoying activities of users, (we can assume that people like to post their images of enjoyment)

It is strange to that most people register on Instagram are on working days. Though Saturday weekend day still it had less no of user registration.

There are 13 fake account who gave likes on each post of Instagram, while this account never posted any content yet.
